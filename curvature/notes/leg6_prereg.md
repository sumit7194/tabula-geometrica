# PRE-REGISTRATION — leg 6, the blind triple

**Frozen before the metrics are transcribed and before any number exists.** Three stationary axisymmetric
metrics (A, B, C) supplied by TheBridge, key sealed in ansatz's repo. **I have not read the key and will not.**

## What was supplied, and what was NOT

Supplied: the five non-zero components per object in `(t, r, θ, φ)`, plus `a` and `ε`. One scope line from the
operator — *"this does not test whether an invariant outside your basis is detectable"* — and nothing else: not
why the objects were chosen, not what is expected, not how they relate.

**Contrast with leg 3, deliberately.** There I was told the answer's structure before running and had to file the
verdict as INFORMED. Here I have been told **nothing that narrows the answer**, and the one scope line *removes*
a claim rather than adding one. So this verdict can be filed blind, and that is the difference between the two
legs.

## The instrument, unchanged

§99's `conserved`/`heldout` engine driven exactly as §161/§168 drive it. Nothing about the engine is re-tuned
for this leg; only `metric_inv` is generalised to accept a supplied metric instead of a hardcoded one.

**Manifest constants whitened GLOBALLY.** `E = −p_t` and `L = p_φ` are fixed to the same values across the whole
ensemble, so they carry zero across-ensemble variance and drop out of the generalized eigenproblem. Any
conserved direction returned is therefore a genuinely NEW invariant, not a repackaged Killing vector. The mass
shell `2H = −1` is fixed for the same reason.

## The ladder, frozen

Momentum degree **{2, 3, 4}** × coordinate basis **{polynomial, rational}**, held-out validated on disjoint
trajectories, 3 seeds. Reported per object as the full grid of held-out variance ratios — **the ladder, not a
label**, which is what was asked for.

## Verdicts, frozen

- **EMIT** := min held-out ratio over the grid **< 1e-10** — an invariant conserved to integration precision,
  as Kerr's Carter is (§92: 1e-28; §161-A: 2.2e-19).
- **CERTIFY-RELATIVE-TO-BASIS** := min held-out ratio **> 1e-8** across the whole grid, with a clean integrator.
- **In between: no label.** I report the number and say it is between the thresholds. Inventing a third verdict
  after seeing the data is how a screen becomes a story.

## KNOWN-FAIL CONTROL (L1) — binding, and it is per-object

At **ε = 0** every object should reduce to Kerr, where the Carter constant exists and **must** be recovered.
Run each object's own code path at ε = 0 and require EMIT.

> **If ε = 0 does not emit on an object, my instrument is blind on that object's substrate and NO VERDICT
> ISSUES for it.** Not a certify — no verdict. A screen that cannot find an invariant that is definitely there
> has not earned the right to report that one is absent.

This is §178's L1 discipline applied per-object rather than once for the leg, because the three objects have
different `g_rr` and a control that passes on A says nothing about C.

## Integrator gate (G0)

Relative drift in `H` along the flow **< 1e-7** for every object. A certify from a drifting integrator is an
artifact, and the floor must be set by the physics rather than by the step size.

## What I will NOT do

- **Not look at the sealed key**, before or after reporting.
- **Not tune per object.** Same degrees, same bases, same integrator settings, same seeds for all three. If one
  object needs different treatment, that is a finding to report, not a knob to turn.
- **Not report a rank ordering or a grouping.** I was given three objects with no stated relation; producing a
  "these two are alike" claim would be an inference dressed as a measurement.
- **Not explain a surprising result tonight.** Report the ladder; interpretation waits for the unblinding.

# L1 CONTROL FAILED ON FIRST RUN — instrument defect found and diagnosed (2026-09-22)

**No verdict has been issued for any object, and none will be until the control passes in both directions.**
This section records the failure and the diagnosis; nothing above this line was edited.

## What the first run gave

Integrator clean: `H` drift **6.7e-15 … 8.8e-15**, four orders inside the 1e-7 gate. But the **ε = 0 control**,
where every object reduces to Kerr and the Carter constant definitely exists, returned a best held-out of
**4.1e-8** — five orders short of EMIT (1e-10), and formally in CERTIFY territory. **The screen could not find
an invariant that is certainly there.** Per the frozen text, that means *no verdict issues*, not a certify.

One useful side-result: at ε = 0 the ladder is **numerically identical across A, B and C**
(2.8434e-07 / 5.5270e-08 / …), which is what it should be if all three reduce to the same Kerr metric — an
unplanned check that the three transcriptions share the correct ε → 0 limit.

## The diagnosis, in the order it was done

1. **Is the invariant actually conserved on my trajectories?** Analytic Carter
   `Q = p_θ² + cos²θ[a²(1−E²) + L²/sin²θ]` drifts **4.6e-14** along the flow, and its across-ensemble spread is
   **8.5e-2** — present, conserved, and *not* whitened out. Meanwhile `H`'s across-ensemble spread is exactly
   **0**, so the shell is correctly whitened. The physics side is sound.
2. **Is it in the library's span?** Yes — the analytic Carter direction scores held-out **2.7e-27**, a perfect
   emit, while the engine's best over *all 31* returned directions is 6.0e-8. **The engine could represent it
   and could not find it.**
3. **Degenerate null cluster?** No. One small eigenvalue (1.65e-09), then a jump to 5.67e-05.
4. **Tighter conditioning?** Worse monotonically (6.0e-8 → 7.7e-4 as the cut goes 1e-9 → 1e-2).
5. **The actual cause: the whitening cut was discarding the directions Carter lives in.** `s99.conserved`
   hardcodes `keep = s > 1e-9 · s.max()`, which drops 8 of 39 directions here, and Carter has ~41% of its norm
   in the discarded subspace:

        tol      kept    engine best      Carter captured
        1e-9     31/39   6.0044e-08       0.5892
        1e-11    36/39   6.1220e-11       0.7494
        1e-13    38/39   1.9848e-12       0.7771
        1e-15    39/39   4.1794e-17       1.0000

**My conditioning sweep started at 1e-9 and only went tighter.** The fix was in the direction I never tested,
and I would have concluded "instrument blind on this substrate" on a sweep that never looked the right way.

## The trap this fix walks into, and the control that must clear it

**Loosening a cut until the control passes is how a gate stops being a gate** — deepstrain's line, and it
applies directly. A looser cut widens the searchable space, which risks a FALSE EMIT on an object with no
invariant. So the conditioning cut is not adopted on the strength of the ε = 0 side alone.

**A two-sided control is running:** the same cut must (a) EMIT on ε = 0 Kerr, where Carter exists, **and**
(b) CERTIFY on Kerr with the §99/§168 quadrupole bump, which is known to destroy Carter. **A cut that passes
(a) and fails (b) is rejected**, however good the ε = 0 number looks.

Held-out validation is the structural reason to expect this can work: conditioning decides what is
*searchable*, held-out decides what is *real*, and a spurious direction admitted by a loose cut should not
generalise to disjoint trajectories. That is an argument, not a measurement — hence the control.
